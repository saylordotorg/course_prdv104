**Unit 2: Workplace Communication** <span id="2"></span> 
*Have you ever worked for an organization where there was little to no
communication about important tasks?  Employees are expected to
interpret information correctly and to communicate with their colleagues
and superiors on a regular basis.  Effective communication can foster
increased motivation and a more positive work environment, yet one of
the leading causes of conflict in the workplace is a lack of adequate or
clear communication.  Miscommunication can arise from a number of
sources, including employees’ poor listening skills, the
misinterpretation of verbal messages or physical gestures, and other
issues.  These potential pitfalls can be avoided with some extra effort
on your behalf.  In the second unit of this course, you will explore the
three main types of workplace communication: verbal, nonverbal, and
virtual.  You will discover how to use these forms of communication
appropriately and how to employ active listening in order to decrease
the likelihood of workplace miscommunication.  Finally, you will
evaluate how workplace technology can affect the communication process.*
