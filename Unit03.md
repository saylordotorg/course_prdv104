**Unit 3: Diversity in the Workplace** <span id="3"></span> 
*The workplace is made up of unique individuals who embody various
cultures, attitudes, and philosophies.  You may have heard the phrase,
“two heads are better than one,” and diversity can indeed add value to a
company due to the benefits gained from additional perspectives and
talents.  In recent years, diversity in the workplace has grown to be an
important and valued issue within corporate culture.  However, diversity
is not without its challenges, because the relationship between
individual values and workplace culture can be complex. 
Miscommunication and insensitivity may occur when employees are unaware
of colleagues’ or clients’ customs.  Mastering professional etiquette
includes gaining an understanding of the various cultural norms in your
own work environment.  In the third and final unit of this course, you
will discover the impact of diversity in the workplace and study the
importance of practicing cultural awareness.  You also will identify
resources for learning about different cultural practices and taboos in
order to avoid any insensitivity.*
