**Unit 1: Workplace Courtesy** <span id="1"></span> 
*Everyday courteous behaviors such as holding the door for the person
behind you, saying “please” and “thank you” at the dinner table, and
smiling when you catch the eye of someone walking by you may be optional
responses to situations outside the workplace.  However, such courtesies
are not optional in the workplace.  Exercising proper courtesy in any
workplace situation is important, and neglecting to do so may lead to
unfavorable results, such as miscommunication.  To help you understand
the standards of appropriate workplace attitudes and behaviors, the
first unit of this course introduces you to basic workplace manners and
the positive behavioral qualities an employer typically looks for in an
employee.  By studying these concepts, you will learn the appropriate
way to handle yourself in many job-related situations.*
